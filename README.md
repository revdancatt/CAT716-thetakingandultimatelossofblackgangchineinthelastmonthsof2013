CAT716 The taking and ultimate loss of blackgang chine in the last months of 2013
=================================================================================

A non-interactive Zombie survival horror game on the Isle of Wight.

This is supposed to be a minimal "game" where the player does nothing beyond create a character and then see how long that character survives.

The ultimate aim is two fold...

1. For the game to create a full and rich story of the character's fight for survival
2. For me to practice some HTML5 fetures such as local storage and local databases

Number 1 is pretty much non-existant at the moment, but we'll get there.


You can "play it" here:

Whoa, just moving things around, bit broken at the moment.
