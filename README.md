The taking and ultimate loss of blackgang chine in the last months of 2013
==========================================================================

A non-interactive Zombie survival horror game on the Isle of Wight.

This is supposed to be a minimal "game" where the player does nothing beyond create a character and then see how long that character survives.

The ultimate aim is two fold...

1. For the game to create a full and rich story of the character's fight for survival
2. For me to practice some HTML5 fetures such as local storage and local databases

Number 1 is pretty much non-existant at the moment, but we'll get there.

You can "play it" here:
